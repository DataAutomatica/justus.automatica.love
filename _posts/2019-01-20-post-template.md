summary: "Today, we're going to make a website that people can go to and see upcoming & past events for an organization! It will be very minimalistic and display just enough information for people to know when the next event is, as well as a little bit of information about the organization if the person finds the website organically! We don't anticipate many organic visitors, mostly visitors from other * Automatica properties because they're all linked together! But if someone does happen to stumble upon this site looking to know more about it, then the events should speak for themselves."
